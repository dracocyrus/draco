            <h2>Findings on Health Implications of E-Waste</h2>
			<br />
            <p><font size="3">Across the globe, countries experience the impact of e-waste differently. Developing nations often bear the brunt, with informal recycling practices exposing workers to toxic substances. Studies show elevated levels of harmful metals in people working at e-waste recycling sites in countries such as India, China, and Ghana.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3">Health effects from e-waste exposure include neurological disorders, increased risk of cancer, respiratory problems, and impaired growth in children. In areas where e-waste processing is unregulated, entire communities, including vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant women, are put at risk. This makes e-waste management a critical public health issue on a global scale.</font></p>

	<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
<p><font size="5">This graph states that e-waste is prevalent around the world. </p>
<br /><br />
  <h1>Exposure Routes</h1>
  <br />
     <li><font size="3"> inhalation: Burning e-waste releases harmful gases and 
 particulates that can be inhaled</font></li>
 <li><font size="3">Ingestion: Toxins from e-waste can contaminate soil and water, 
  entering the food chain and being ingested by humans.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Dermal contact: Direct handling of e-waste can lead to skin absorption of hazardous chemicals.</font></li>
<br /><br />
  <h2>Impact on Vulnerable Populations</h2>
  <br />
         <li><font size="3">Children are particularly vulnerable to e-waste toxins due to their developing organs and nervous systems.</font> </li>
		     <li><font size="3">Pregnant women exposed to e-waste toxins may experience complications such as spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and premature births.</font></li>
			    <li><font size="3">Workers in informal e-waste recycling sectors often lack protective equipment, making them more susceptible to exposure-related health problems.</font></li>
			<br /><br />
  <h3>Environmental Contamination</h3>
  <br />
   <li><font size="3">E-waste, when improperly disposed of, can lead to environmental contamination. Toxic substances can seep into the soil and water, 
affecting not only human health but also wildlife and ecosystems.</font></li>
	    <br /><br /> 
  <h4>Solutions and Interventions<h4>
  <br />
   <li><font size="3">Implementing strict regulations for e-waste disposal and recycling</font></li>
      <li><font size="3">Promoting safer recycling practices to reduce exposure risks, particularly in developing countries where informal recycling is prevalent.</font></li>
	     <li><font size="3">Raising awareness about the dangers of e-waste and the importance of proper disposal.</font></li>
		 <li><font size="3">Developing e-waste management infrastructures that minimize human and environmental exposure to hazardous substances.</font></li>
		   <li><font size="3">Reducing e-waste and managing it responsibly is crucial to mitigating these health risks and protecting both human and environmental health.</font></li>
